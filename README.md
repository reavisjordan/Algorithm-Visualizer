# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

This program is designed to provide a visual experience of the sorting process for various algorithms, including bubble sort, selection sort, merge sort, and more. In addition to a visual representation, a short analysis of each algorithm's time and space complexity is provided. This program was created using the SFML library, which can be found here: https://www.sfml-dev.org/.
